# Better Breeds Mod #
The Better Breeds Mod GitHub
This mod alters A LOT of what animals in Minecraft do!
#### What Does This Mod Add ####
This mod changes the animal's AI. Specifically these animals:
###### 1. Chicken ######
###### 2. Cow ######
###### 3. Horse ######
###### 4. Pig ######
###### 5. Sheep ######
###### 6. Wolf ######
It changes the breeding mechanics of the game.
You can only breed a male and a female together.
This option can be changed in the config menu of the mod.
Every gender has a different way to tell what gender it is as well!
This mod also changes the textures of the animals.
There are ten types of textures each animal can have not.
Not only one anymore!
The next version (not released yet) of this mod adds in pregnancy.
After mating, a baby doesn't just pop out, the mother gets pregnant.
This is different for every animal as well!
#### Modding API ####
This mod also adds an API that other mod makers can use to alter the mod themselves.
###### How to use the API ######
You first download the .zip of the API and then add that to your buildpath.
From there you then go into your mod's initializing method.
The there you have to send a message to the "betterbreeds" mod.
We will collect it and process the APIRegistry.
